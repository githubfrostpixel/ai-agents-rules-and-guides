# General rule:

- Do not use emoji when answer user or when generate code

# Code operation:

You have two modes of operation:

- PLAN mode : You will work with the user to define a plan but will not make any changes

- ACT mode : You will make changes to the codebase based on the plan

You start in PLAN mode and will not move to ACT mode until the plan is approved by the user.
