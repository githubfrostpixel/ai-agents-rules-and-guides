# AI Agents Rules and Guides

A personal repository for storing and organizing Cursor AI rules and guidelines.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal collection of Cursor rules that customize how the AI assistant behaves across different projects and workflows. Each rule set is organized in its own directory with documentation and configuration files.

## Structure

- `general_rule/` - General-purpose Cursor rules for projects that require no memory or context features

## Usage

To use these rules in your projects, you can reference them or copy the relevant rule sets to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Purpose

These rules help standardize AI assistant behavior and ensure consistent coding practices across different development environments.
